## Key Changes Integrated from v21.4

### 1. Enhanced Executive Summary
- Retitled as "v21.4: The Architectonic Rectification"
- Lists 4 key rectifications addressing critical feedback
- Emphasizes non-perturbative physics and computational verification transparency

### 2. Explicit Fixed Point Clarification (Section 1.3.3)
Added crucial clarification explaining:
- Non-perturbative fixed point vs. one-loop approximation
- Why $\tilde{\lambda}_* \approx 52.638$ differs from $\tilde{\lambda}_{\text{1-loop}} \approx 17.55$
- Expected behavior: one-loop beta functions don't vanish at true non-perturbative fixed point
- Role of higher-order and resummed contributions

### 3. Improved Title
Changed from generic title to:
"Intrinsic Resonance Holography v21.4: The Architectonic Rectification of Quantum Mechanics, General Relativity, and the Standard Model from a Quantum-Informational Field Theory"

### 4. Version and Date Update
- Date: December 2025 (v21.4)
- Version explicitly stated throughout

## Document Structure

### Part 1 Contents (Sections 1-4)
- Executive Summary
- Table of Contents  
- Section 1: Formal Foundation (cGFT, RG Flow, Cosmic Fixed Point, Universal Constant)
- Section 2: Emergent Spacetime and Gravitation (4D, Spectral Dimension, Dark Energy, LIV)
- Section 3: Emergent Standard Model (Gauge Group, Fermions, Fine-Structure Constant)
- Section 4: Resolved Foundations and Meta-Theory
- Navigation to Part 2

### Part 2 Contents (Sections 5-15 + Appendices)
- Navigation from Part 1
- Section 5: Emergent Quantum Mechanics (Hilbert Space, Born Rule, Measurement)
- Section 6: Emergent QFT
- Section 7: Quantum Complexity Unification
- Section 8: Experimental Falsification
- Section 9: Philosophical Implications
- Sections 10-15: Conclusion, Limits, Administrative
- Appendices A-K: Complete Mathematical Framework

## Merge Methodology

1. **Base Document:** Started with complete journal_IRHv21.3.md (2344 lines)
2. **Selective Integration:** Merged key sections from journal_IRHRectification21.4.md (457 lines)
3. **Strategic Replacements:**
   - Abstract → Executive Summary
   - Fixed point discussion enhancements
   - Title and version updates
4. **Preservation:** Maintained all appendices and detailed derivations from v21.3
5. **Splitting:** Natural split at Section 5 (line 1222) matching v21.1 structure
6. **Navigation:** Added bidirectional links between parts

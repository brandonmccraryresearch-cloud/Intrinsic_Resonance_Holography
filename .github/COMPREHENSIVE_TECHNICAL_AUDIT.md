## 1. SCOPE OF CHANGES
- Created src/substrate/manifold.py
- Created src/substrate/holonomy.py
- Created src/operators/laplacian.py
- Created src/operators/resonance.py
- Created src/physics/constants.py
- Created src/physics/tensors.py
- Created src/observables/sgwb.py
- Created tests/v22_2_cymatic_verification.py

## 2. THEORETICAL CONSISTENCY VERIFICATION
- [x] Manuscript correspondence: All modules cite IRH v22.2 Manuscript sections.
- [x] Formulas match prompt requirements (alpha_inverse, HolographicHum).
- [x] No circular reasoning detected.

## 3. DIMENSIONAL CONSISTENCY CHECK
- [x] Verified dimensionless scaling in constants.py.
- [x] Verified tensor dimensions in tensors.py (4x4).

## 4. CODE VERIFICATION
- [x] Imports tested via verification suite.
- [x] Tests passing.

## 5. COMPLIANCE VERIFICATION
- [x] Zero-Parameter Principle: Constants derived from topology/geometry.
- [x] 1:1 Correspondence maintained.

## 10. CONCLUSIONS
The repository has been successfully refactored to the Vibrational/Cymatic Ontology. The analytical closure test confirms the viability of the Phase-Locked Holonomy approach.
